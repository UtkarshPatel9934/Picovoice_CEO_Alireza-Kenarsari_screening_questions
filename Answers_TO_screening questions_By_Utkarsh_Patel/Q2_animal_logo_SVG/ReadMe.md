Q2. [SVG] Picovoice uses animal names for its products. For example Porcupine, Rhino, Cobra, Cheetah, and Octopus. How would you go about creating logos for these? Please describe your approach and design choices. Pick an animal and design the logo for it.





			Animal logo Designing - Panda



Approach: 
-> for designing process of the panda, here I am using Adobe Illustrator, so first of all, I created a new file and setup the document in it and make sure everything is fine and after that I created the basic mockup or rough drawing on paper and trying to mimic same on the illustrator with the help of Pen Tool, using different Shapes to design it's body parts accordingly and made it with black and white colour combination as of its original body colour. Finally, convert the .ai file to the SVG format as per requirement in the question pdf



				Step by Step Process:

step 1: 
-> set up the document for creating a design for Panda.

step 2: 
-> select the Ellipse Tool to design the face for the Panda, after that with the same tool I created nose, eyes and legs for it.

step 3: 
-> select the Line Segment Tool and Pen Tool for creating the smile on the Panda's face.

step 4: 
-> then I select Pen Tool again and made the outer dark area around the eyes and design its hand.

step 5: 
-> now again select Ellipse Tool and make two rounded circles and with the help of the pathfinder, I used the minus-back option in order to make its ears and apply the same process to craft its lower body part.

step 6: 
-> after that combine every designed part in its position and group it as a whole Panda.

step 7: 
-> finally converted the .ai file to the SVG format.
